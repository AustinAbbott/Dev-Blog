I keep hearing about Kagi, so I decided to pay for unlimited searches for a month ($10 at the time of this article) and compare it to Brave Search. I currently use the free tier of Brave Search, but the only difference between the free and pair tier is ads in the search results or not.

These are the only settings I changed from default:

Brave:

Google Fallback Mixing

Considering Kagi uses a variety of sources, it seemed fair to enable Google Fallback Mixing for Brave.

Kagi: None.

#### Winner: Kagi

I like that Kagi displayed an official guide from Apple first, that's what I'm typically looking for when resetting a device.
