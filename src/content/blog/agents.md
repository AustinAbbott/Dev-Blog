### Problem

Some agents require custom agent files and don't support/respect `AGENTS.md` yet.

### Solution

Create your custom agent file (i.e., `GEMINI.md`, `CLAUDE.md`) and write:

```
See AGENTS.md for codebase guidelines
```

It's seriously that easy ðŸ˜‚

For more context on `AGENTS.md`, see [agents.md](https://agents.md/)
